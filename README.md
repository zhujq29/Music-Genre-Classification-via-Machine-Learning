# Music Genre Classification via Machine Learning
This is the group project for STATS503 at Umich. 

We performed machine learning models on music data set from Kaggle to predict genre of music. Within the project, seven classification models were built, which were KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, and MLP. 

The project was done with Python, R, and Jupyter Notebook.
